# 1. When does a physical system compute?
+ This journal looks into how we define a computation device also how do we know when a computation is happening, physical computation is defined as a physical system preforming internal interactions, which consists of abstract entity/ computation input and produces an output, we should feel confident that the output is correct. With this theory they use a series of computing diagrams that can be used on many different systems, e.g. A computers abstract entity refers to its programming in a physical system, a computing system must also be capable of encoding, decoding and embedding. In greater depth inputs are broken down into smaller operations in standard gate-based computers, which is what this journal concentrates on, physical computational devices are capable or changing high-level assembly language into low-level assembly language (1, 0) without human input. Though computational output can changed depending on the words (such as AND, OR, NOT) used to program a process. The main factor that defines a computational device is the ability to encode and decode without this there is no computation and it would just be considered a physical system. Computational devices are also used to simulate anything using virtual environments
+ Everyone has a different idea of what a computational device is and this journal concentrated on the framework of the devices, while also stating that a human could be a computational entity. I agree about the importance of encoding and decoding in computing.
