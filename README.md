# 1. When does a physical system compute?

This journal looks into how we define a computation device and also how we know when a computation is happening. Physical computation is defined as a physical system performing internal interactions, which consists of abstract entity, computation input and produces an output. We should feel confident that the output is correct. With this theory, the authors use a series of computing diagrams that can be used on many different systems, e.g. a computers abstract entity refers to its programming in a physical system. Other examples include a computing system which must also be capable of encoding, decoding and embedding. The article then goes into greater depth and dicusses how inputs are broken down into smaller operations in standard gate-based computers, which is what this journal concentrates on. Furthermore, physical computational devices are capable of changing high-level assembly language into low-level assembly language (1, 0) without human input. Though computational output can change depending on the words (such as AND, OR, NOT) used to program a process. The main factor that defines a computational device is the ability to encode and decode, without this there is no computation and it would just be considered a physical system. Computational devices are also used to simulate anything using virtual environments.

In conclusion, this paper highlights the fact that everyone has a different idea of what a computational device is and this journal concentrated on the framework of the devices, whilst also stating that a human could themselves be a computational entity. I agree about the importance of encoding and decoding in computing in regards to defining a computational device.
